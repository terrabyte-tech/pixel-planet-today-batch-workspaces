# Open Workspaces via Batch file!

Easily open a series of webpages that are needed for various Pixel Planet Today workflows.

Batch files and what they do:

- `-new-post` opens websites used to post on social media about a new Pixel Planet Today post
- `-new-blog-post` opens websites used to post on the Pixel Planet Today blog

**Note:** These configurations align with the setup of Sammy's machine. In order to create one for yourself, create your own branch and make adjustments accordingly.
